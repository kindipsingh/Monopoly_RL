00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:11.739
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So in this video I will demonstrate how to use monopoly monopoly simulator. So as you can see, here is my repo, and here's the folder.

2
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.170
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and here is the common line. Relate to this folder, as you can see.

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.359
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and this common line is, I will I will use it later for execute the client. Software.

4
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.009
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So that's me started from scratch.

5
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.619
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So as you can see, it's now it is empty.

6
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.363
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let us just

7
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.390
Min-Hsueh Chiu: copy the bit

8
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.660
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and then

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.230
Min-Hsueh Chiu: bonus repo.

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.999
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so right now, we have the repo here.

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.209
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and what we need to do

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.219
Min-Hsueh Chiu: is to multiple

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.730
Min-Hsueh Chiu: modify, modify to the right.

14
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.439
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Let me just directly copy it. So this will be are using this branch.

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.260
Min-Hsueh Chiu: which is phase 3. Final. This print?

16
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.749
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Oh, yeah. So I need to go into this folder

17
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.820
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and yeah, right now, I'm switched to the new branch.

18
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.650
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, as you can see.

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.430
Min-Hsueh Chiu: I'm retina in a new branch. And so

20
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.419
Min-Hsueh Chiu: here, I'm going to

21
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920
Min-Hsueh Chiu: create

22
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.230
Min-Hsueh Chiu: virtual environment

23
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.199
Min-Hsueh Chiu: that Dmv.

24
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.579
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and then

25
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.260
Min-Hsueh Chiu: I will

26
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.239
Min-Hsueh Chiu: executed so as you can see right now, I'm in my virtual environment.

27
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.170
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And then

28
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.763
Min-Hsueh Chiu: I will

29
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.180
Min-Hsueh Chiu: instill

30
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.160
Min-Hsueh Chiu: what I need for this package.

31
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.990
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Basically, it's just numpy.

32
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.880
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so here, I think, our environment is already set up.

33
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.520
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and

34
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.430
Min-Hsueh Chiu: what I need to do here is maybe I can show you the execute

35
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.740
Min-Hsueh Chiu: while first.st

36
00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.560
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Here it is.

37
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.570
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Here's the execute

38
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.980
Min-Hsueh Chiu: underscore phase 3.sh!

39
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.580
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, let me scroll a little bit

40
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.270
Min-Hsueh Chiu: so as you can see, here is the user parameter.

41
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.210
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and here is config, the for example, python path and then execute the function.

42
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.079
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let me show you

43
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.330
Min-Hsueh Chiu: when the when using background player

44
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to play themselves.

45
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.860
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So basically, what I need to do

46
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.920
Min-Hsueh Chiu: is to just execute

47
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.519
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this bash file.

48
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.420
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and you can see.

49
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.490
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Let

50
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.970
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the game already playing right now, and it is done because I just play locally. So you can see here.

51
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.890
Min-Hsueh Chiu: outside the monopoly simulator folder, you can see. Here is a tournament log generated.

52
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.300
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and inside here you can see

53
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.209
Min-Hsueh Chiu: learn log

54
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.099
Min-Hsueh Chiu: for every game. So right now, I just have 2 game, as you can see here in a number game.

55
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.700
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And I'm using the novelty which is environment. Underscore 9.

56
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.030
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so this is how I would I would use

57
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.920
Min-Hsueh Chiu: for the

58
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.820
Min-Hsueh Chiu: background agent that is branded itself.

59
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.769
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So now I would demonstrate how to

60
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.749
Min-Hsueh Chiu: play with user software.

61
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.840
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So as you can see, I change my user agent to ta 2 agent. So this is the indicator

62
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.890
Min-Hsueh Chiu: are giving into the function that

63
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.520
Min-Hsueh Chiu: saying, I'm going to use a socket connection.

64
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.989
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let me.

65
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.010
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay. So for

66
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.699
Min-Hsueh Chiu: clarifications I will multiply

67
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.030
Min-Hsueh Chiu: list number 10, so it will generate another folder later.

68
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.360
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and let me do it again.

69
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.619
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So as you can see that

70
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:55.990
Min-Hsueh Chiu: in a previous execution, I just it's it's run directly, because it's just using the background agent. But right now, since we are going to use client software.

71
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.979
Min-Hsueh Chiu: so it is waiting con waiting connection here

72
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.410
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and so right now, I'm going to execute

73
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.640
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the software that is developed by Umass

74
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.369
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and I already config all of the environments for them. So when you

75
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.701
Min-Hsueh Chiu: do when when you execute the

76
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.610
Min-Hsueh Chiu: client software, it is very important to make sure every environment parameter is okay.

77
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.950
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let me execute their

78
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.790
Min-Hsueh Chiu: layer software here.

79
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.300
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So as you can see, game is started.

80
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.299
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And also it is showing on my game engine side.

81
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.129
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So inside here.

82
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.630
Min-Hsueh Chiu: you can see the log is updating.

83
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.039
Min-Hsueh Chiu: based on

84
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.309
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the

85
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.969
Min-Hsueh Chiu: based on the the client is playing

86
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.440
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right?

87
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.029
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And right now it's heading to the game game 2.

88
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.590
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And similarly.

89
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.040
Min-Hsueh Chiu: it is running.

90
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.129
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay? So that is how

91
00:06:15.963 --> 00:06:17.129
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to connect

92
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.700
Min-Hsueh Chiu: client and game engine.
