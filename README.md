# Monopoly Reinforcement Learning

This project creates a reinforcement learning agent that plays Monopoly.

## Description
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent agent that can learn to play Monopoly through reinforcement learning techniques. The agent will be trained through various simulations and will continuously improve its playing strategy.

## Language Composition
- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- Other libraries as necessary (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kindipsingh/Monopoly_RL.git
   cd Monopoly_RL
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Basic understanding of reinforcement learning concepts

Feel free to contribute to the project!
